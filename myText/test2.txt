the FiOS itself is awesome.. super fast and reliable... but the customer service and website is some of the worst I have ever experienced. I absolutely DREAD needing to call in for support. Also, I was on auto draft for billing, and one day I got a bill that said my last payment was never paid. I called, and they said "oh, that was a glitch in our system, you'll need to sign up again". No email or call from them at all to let me know this happened. I have to call them!
Verizon FiOS is one of few fiber optic cable providers, meaning you can expect an exceptionally high-quality picture. FiOS rates can run high, but if you are lucky enough to live within a service area, the reliability and immense channel lineup is worth it.
On a recent inquiry on my account the Verizon Fios Rep. said if I upgrade my old equipment to Quantom I would get more and save $4 a month. Instead my bill went up over $20 and there were over $80 in upgrade fees. When I called to complain they said they had no record of the offer and would not honor it. I asked them to check the voice recording between me and the rep and they of course said that was not possible and they said too bad. ** from customer server was a condescending jerk.
My Fios cable was cut on May 6. They said they would fix it on May 13. No one came. They said they would fix it May 14. No one came. They said they would fix it May 15. No one came. Now they say they will fix it May 18. The consequence for my wife have been no phone and no web making it very hard to do her job.
FIOS did get back to me after I submitted my complaint to consumer affairs. FIOS made it right, and they were very apologetic. They took the price of the rate increase off of my bill. I was surprised and I am now very happy with FIOS. I wish they helped me before I bashed them on this forum.
Verizon charged me for movies and boxing fights I did not order. When pressed, they claim they know I ordered it, and I do not know what I did or did not do. After much discussion, they offered this for a compromise: how about I get some packages on future boxing matches as a concession. This is after I told them I do not watch boxing, period.
I switched to Verizon from Comcast and believe I was misled! First and foremost they dropped the weather channel and gave us an Accuweather channel that gives me weather for everyone but my local area.
